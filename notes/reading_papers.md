# Reading a Paper 
1) 1st pass (Most important)
    - Skim over
        - title, abstract, introduction
        - section, subs-ection headings
        - conclusion
        - references
    - 5 C's aftering skimming
        - Category
        - Context
        - Correctness
        - Contributions
        - Clarity
2) 2nd pass (takes about an hour)
    - ignore specific details (proofs)
    - care of illustrations
    - mark relevant unread references (for further reading)
    - forget it / third pass / return to paper later
3) 3rd pass
    - try to virtually re-implement the paper
    - challenge every assumption
