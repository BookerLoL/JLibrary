# Artificial Intelligence
## Introduction
- Automation of intellignece behavior
- Testing
    - **Turing Test**
        - Interrogator: decide which is human and machine
- Intelligence = Perceive + Analyze + React
- Common Features
    - Representation
        - knowledge representation
    - Learning
        - capability of learning
    - Rules
        - explicit/implicit 
    - Search
        - optimal settings / faster solution
- Subfields
    - Speech processing
    - Natural Language Processing
    - Planning
    - Engineering and Expert Systems
    - Fuzzy Systems
    - Models of Brain and Evolutionary
    - Machine vision and robotics
    - Machine Learning
## Logic
- Many AI based on logic / deductive reasoning
- Can: dicern good vs bad reasoning, invalid arguments, inductive vs deductive arguments, fallacies.
- **Argumentation Theory**
    - no consideration of the truth
    - set of premises (1+) -> reason/deduce -> conclusion (1)
- **Prepositional Logic**
    - Operators
        - ∧ conjunction (and)
        - ∨ disjunction (or)
        - ¬ not 
        - → implication, i.e., if ... than ... rule
        - ⊥ contradiction (false).
    - BNF representation
        - formula := atomicFormula | formula ^ formula | ...
        - atomicFormula := ⊥ | p | q | r | p0 | p1 | p2 | ...

## Rule Based Reasoning
- If (Cond) then (...)
- Comprise of
    - Knowledge base
        - collection of facts & rules 
    - Inference engine
- **Deduction System**
    - if (cond) then assertion
- **Reaction System**
    - if (cond) then actions
- Forward Chaining
    - data-driven systems
    - selection process
        - pre-selection: find set of all matching rules (conflict-set)
        - selection: select rule from conflict-set
