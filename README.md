# JLibrary

- This is an on-going project to serve as educational purposes to show examples of implementing concepts.
- Hopefully this will provide as a nice reference to make improvements or even possible use the library for your own needs.

## Goals

- I'm hoping to later host a website to present these ideas visually.
- The concepts will get deeper and more advance later on.
- I've added readme files to help explain, but will add more documentation later.

## Notes

- There might be long breaks where I may not work on this but will find myself coming back to improve the code, structure, make changes, or continue developing even more.
