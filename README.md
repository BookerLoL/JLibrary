# JLibrary
- This is an on-going project to serve as educational purposes to show examples of implementing concepts.
- Concepts that I hope to cover only in Java
    - Natural Language Processing
    - Compilers
    - Video Games
    - JavaFX
    - Computer Graphics
    - Data Structures
    - Optimization
    - Design Patterns
    - Artifical Intelligence
    - Machine Learning
    - Image Processing
    - Tests
    - Etc

## Goals
- I'm hoping to later host a website to present these ideas visually.
- The concepts will get deeper and more advance later on.
- I've added readme files to help explain, but will add more documentation later.
