# AI
## Basics
- Probelm -> Machine learning
    - Data classification -> classify data
        - supervised training, use known data and classes 
            - Fisherâ€™s Iris Dataset	
    - Regression analysis -> number
        - ex: given car info -> mpg
    - Clustering -> group data
        - unsupervised training
        - no provision for new data to group
    - Timer series
        - ex: predicting stocks based on previous days of stock prices
- **Translating inputs as a vector**
    - Important to normalize values within a range
        - large range is best, avoid too much extreme ends data
    - XOR
        - [0.0, 0.0] -> [0.0] //false xor false = false
        - [1.0, 0.0] -> [1.0] //true xor false = true
    - Stocks
        - array of % changed [0.04, 0.02, -0.16] -> 0.02
- Evaluate success -> scoring function
- Online training: learns after eahc set element
- Batch training: learns after X amount of elements 
- Supervised training: provide expected outputs
- Unsupervised training: don't provide expected outputs
- hybrid training: some outputs provided
- Deterministic training: train same given a state
- stochastic training: train differently due to randomness
## Normalizing
- Qualitative data: qualities/descriptions
- Quantative data: quantities/numbers
- Data categories
    - Nominal, Ordinal (qualitative)
    - Interval, Ratio (quantitative)
- **Nominal Normalizing**
    - One-of-n encoding (one hot encoders)
        - [#, #, #, nominal (category)] 
            - ex: 0 0 1, 0 1 0, 1 0 0  [3 categories represented]
                - could use -1 insetad of 0
    - equilateral encoding
- **Ordinal Noramalizing**
    - ex: 
    - preschool (0),..., second grade(3), ..., senior (13)
    - % = grade value / total grades 
    - **Normalize between range**: -1 to 1
        - width = (high - low) 
        - lowerbound + (width * %) 
        - ex: second grade with -1 to 1 range
            - second grade -> 3 / 14 -> (3/14) * (1 - (- 1)) + -1
    - **Denormalize normalized ranged value**
        - ( denomralized val - lowerbound / width ) * total categories
- **Quantitative Normalizing**
    - Normalizing
        - data range = dataHigh - dataLow
        - normalize range = normalHigh - normalLow
        - data% = (value - data low) / data range
        - normalized value = (data% * normalize range) + normalLow
    - Denormalize
        - ((normalized value  - normalLow) / normalize range) * datarange + dataLow
- Recirprocal normalize: -1 - 1 range, 1 / x
